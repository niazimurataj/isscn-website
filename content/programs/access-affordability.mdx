# Access & Affordability

Security shouldn't be a privilege of large corporations. Our access and affordability program helps businesses of all sizes implement effective supply chain security measures.

## The Affordability Challenge

Many small and medium exporters face significant barriers to improving security:

- **High upfront costs** for tracking devices and monitoring systems
- **Limited expertise** to evaluate and implement solutions
- **Competing priorities** in resource-constrained operations
- **Lack of awareness** about available funding and support

These barriers leave vulnerable businesses exposed to criminal exploitation and put the entire supply chain at risk.

## Our Solutions

### Grant Facilitation

We help businesses identify and apply for funding:

- **Government grants** for trade security improvements
- **Development programs** supporting Latin American exporters
- **Industry initiatives** from associations and trade groups
- **Foundation funding** for supply chain security projects

### Micro-Grants (Coming Soon)

As our funding allows, we plan to offer direct financial support:

- Small grants for security equipment purchases
- Subsidized access to tracking and monitoring services
- Funding for certification preparation and audits

### In-Kind Support

We provide non-monetary assistance including:

- Free compliance consulting through our enablement program
- Discounted rates negotiated with technology vendors
- Training materials and implementation guides
- Peer networking with other program participants

## Eligibility

Our access and affordability programs prioritize:

- Small and medium enterprises
- Exporters in high-risk industries and regions
- Businesses demonstrating commitment to security improvement
- Companies unable to afford commercial consulting rates
