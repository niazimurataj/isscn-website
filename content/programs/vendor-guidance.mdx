- **Reliability**: System uptime, durability, and support quality
- **Affordability**: Total cost of ownership for different business sizes
- **Integration**: Compatibility with existing systems and processes
- **Compliance**: Alignment with CTPAT, BASC, and other standards

### Categories We Cover

- Container tracking and monitoring systems
- Tamper-evident seals and locks
- Chemical and biological detection sensors
- Surveillance and access control systems
- Traceability and documentation software
- Communication and alert systems

## Our Commitment to Neutrality

We maintain strict independence in our evaluations:

- **No referral fees**: We don't accept payments from vendors for recommendations
- **Transparent criteria**: Our evaluation methodology is publicly available
- **Conflict disclosure**: Any relationships with vendors are clearly disclosed
