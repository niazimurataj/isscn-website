# Industry Education & Outreach

Our flagship education program provides free, accessible resources to help businesses understand and address supply chain security challenges.

## What We Offer

### Annual Public Report

Our comprehensive annual report examines the state of supply chain security, emerging threats, and best practices. The report includes:

- Analysis of smuggling trends and methods
- Case studies of successful security implementations
- Recommendations for industry and policymakers
- Data on technology adoption and effectiveness

### Newsletter

Stay informed with our regular newsletter covering:

- Industry news and regulatory updates
- Practical security tips and guides
- Upcoming events and training opportunities
- Partner spotlights and success stories

### Tailored Industry Outreach

We conduct targeted outreach to industries at highest risk of supply chain contamination:

- **Ecuadorian Banana Exporters**: Our initial focus area, given the industry's vulnerability to drug smuggling
- **Latin American Agricultural Exporters**: Expanding to other high-risk commodities
- **Seafood and Fish Exporters**: Addressing emerging threats in maritime food supply chains

## Why Education Matters

Many businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, lack awareness of:

- The specific risks they face from criminal organizations
- Available security technologies and their effectiveness
- Certification programs like CTPAT and BASC
- Resources for implementing compliance programs

Our education initiatives bridge this knowledge gap, empowering businesses to take proactive steps to protect themselves.
