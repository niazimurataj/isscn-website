# Executive Summary

The Institute for Shipping Security and Technology presents its inaugural annual report, providing a comprehensive analysis of supply chain security challenges facing Latin American exporters, with particular focus on the banana export industry.

## Key Findings

### The Scale of the Problem

- An estimated **$84 billion** worth of cocaine moves through global supply chains annually
- Latin American banana exports have become a primary vector for drug smuggling
- Small and medium exporters are disproportionately affected due to limited security resources

### Industry Response

- Only **23%** of surveyed exporters have implemented comprehensive security programs
- Cost remains the primary barrier to security adoption
- Awareness of available resources and certifications is low

### Emerging Solutions

- Container tracking technology adoption increased **47%** year-over-year
- Blockchain-based traceability solutions are gaining traction
- Public-private partnerships show promise in high-risk corridors

## Recommendations

1. **Expand access** to affordable security technology for small exporters
2. **Strengthen** public-private information sharing mechanisms
3. **Harmonize** security standards across trading partners
4. **Increase** funding for compliance training and education

## Looking Ahead

ISST is committed to advancing these recommendations through our programs and partnerships. We invite stakeholders across the supply chain to join us in building more secure, transparent trade networks.
