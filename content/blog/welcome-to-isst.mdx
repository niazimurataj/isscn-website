We are proud to announce the launch of the Institute for Shipping Security and Technology (ISST), a nonprofit organization dedicated to making borders and societies safer by empowering businesses to strengthen their supply chain security.

## Our Mission

The global narcotics trade exploits legitimate supply chains, putting honest businesses at risk and undermining international trade. ISST exists to change this reality by:

- **Educating** industry stakeholders on compliance best practices
- **Enabling** businesses to implement robust traceability systems
- **Connecting** companies with vetted security technology providers
- **Advocating** for transparent, auditable supply chains

## Why Now?

Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in drug smuggling through commercial shipping containers. Criminal organizations target legitimate exporters, contaminating shipments and putting businesses at legal and financial risk.

Many companies, particularly small and medium exporters in Latin America, lack the resources and knowledge to protect themselves. ISST bridges this gap by providing free compliance consulting, educational resources, and access to affordable security solutions.

## Get Involved

Whether you're an exporter looking to strengthen your supply chain security, a technology provider with solutions to offer, or an individual passionate about our mission, we welcome your involvement.
